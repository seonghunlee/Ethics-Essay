Our biggest defining characteristic as human beings is our intellect. Needless to say we are not the strongest, the fastest or the most resilient to change that nature has to offer. Still we populate most of the biomes this world has to offer and consciously define our lives and our habitats like no other on Earth. All of this in spite of our frailty compared to what nature has to offer, and all of this due to the only advantage that nature gave us; our ability to think better than any other animal that we know of.

This success that we had in the last few millennia is mainly due to our ability to make tools to complement our selves; we have made tools that made our environment more habitable, ensured our food supply, increased our strength and dexterity and improved our ability to carry out mental activities. However, after millennia of progress we are approaching a new dimension of technology and starting to see the other side. The side which were foretold by the legends of Icarus, Pandora’s box and Prometheus’ fire.
