\subsection{Risks of cybernetic augmentation}
{\color{red} This section needs further elaboration. A basic overview is given in bullet points.}


\begin{itemize}
	\item Short-term risks that the lack of knowledge and maturity of the technology may harm the bodies and decrease the convenience, as opposed to the original intentions.
	\item Unknown psychological side-effect
	\item Increased life expectancy has side effects: over population, increased social-welfare cost, youth unemployment, etc.
	\item Increased sense of insecurity (Analogous to gun control issue)
	\item Employment issue (i.e. few people replacing many people's job)
	\item Military application can be problematic in view of ethics. Can we justify the use of cybernetic augmentation to produce a stronger army? What is the soldiers' point of view, and what is the significance for the humanity?
	\item Necessity to change many regulations and laws, as well as to create ones
	\item Inequality issue - The rich is most likely to get an earlier (or even monopolistic) access to such technology and gain an unfair advantage of cybernetic augmentation.
	\item Human dignity - loss of "humanness"
	
\end{itemize}
