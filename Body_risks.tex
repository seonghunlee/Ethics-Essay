\subsection{Risks of cybernetic augmentation}
{\color{red} This bullet-list is made by Seong - These are the risks of physical CA}


\begin{itemize}
	\item Short-term risks that the lack of knowledge and maturity of the technology may harm the bodies and decrease the convenience, as opposed to the original intentions.
	\item Unknown psychological side-effect
	\item Increased life expectancy has side effects: over population, increased social-welfare cost, youth unemployment, etc.
	\item Increased sense of insecurity (Analogous to gun control issue)
	\item Employment issue (i.e. few people replacing many people's job)
	\item Military application can be problematic in view of ethics. Can we justify the use of cybernetic augmentation to produce a stronger army? What is the soldiers' point of view, and what is the significance for the humanity?
	\item Necessity to change many regulations and laws, as well as to create ones
	\item Inequality issue - The rich is most likely to get an earlier (or even monopolistic) access to such technology and gain an unfair advantage of cybernetic augmentation.
	\item Human dignity - loss of "humanness"
	
\end{itemize}

{\color{red} The following bullet-list is made by Manan - These are the risks of cognitive CA that you wrote in the first draft}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Risk to humanbody, humanity and way of life
	\item Affordability leading to human segregation and social startification (violation of utilitarian ethics)
	%\item Different classes of humanity with different rights (rethinking of basic human rights)
	\item Communicatability between two types of sensory enhanced human
	\item Need for rethinking of most institutions; e.g. having memory chips would nullify most academic tests we have now.
	\item Manipulation of memory which maybe argued as fundamental to the fabric of human character formation (violation of virtue ethics; barrier to eudamonia)
	\item Misuse of this technology; potential harm that humanity can unleash on itself with these enhancements. This may express itself as the following (violation of duty ethics):
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Mind reading
		\item Potential hacking of other human beings
		\item Misuse by the government; e.g. with interrogation, monitoring of citizens thoughts, or altering their personality
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
