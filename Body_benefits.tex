\subsection{Benefits of CA}

There can be numerous potential benefits when the CA is implemented to enhance the user's physical and/or cognitive ability. In this essay, some of the main benefits of CA are considered and discussed. Certain technologies are mentioned as examples to illustrate these benefits; the authors realize that these technologies can easily be risks, however in this part of the discussion only the prospective benefits are mentioned. The benefits discussed are: easing hardships, improvements to health and survivability, creation of new opportunities, improvements to safety and welfare, improvements to efficiency and creation of happiness. Of course, there will be many other unmentioned potential benefits (and risks), but it should be noted that our intention is to give an overview and "food for thought" that is useful and adequate to comprehend the general implications, rather than to give you an exhaustive list of every possibility in the future. 

{\bf (1) Ease hardships} \\ 
One way that the CA can be used to achieve the sense of better well-being is by enabling the users to carry out their daily actions in a more convenient way. For example, with augmented arms or legs, one may never have to struggle when lifting or carrying things. Also, the level of pain might be controlled in those augmented organs - for example, when you touch something very cold or hot beyond a certain threshold level, then it may regulate the synaptic information to your nerve system that you do not feel the pain you would have felt if you were not augmented. Such technology of physical CA can give the user more control over their bodies, and thus reduce the level of inconvenience and stress. Furthermore, one can also consider the use of sensory/cognitive augmentation, such as an augmented eye which enables the user to see clearly during night with little light; this may be done by modifying or improving visual prosthesis devices \cite{shepherd2013visual}. Another kind of cognitive augmentation can be a computer chip that can be implemented in the brain to enhance the memory capability \cite{berger2011cortical}. Such technology of cognitive CA can lead to the better perception and management of daily-life information.

{\bf (2) Improve health and survivability} \\
Since CA will enhance the mind and the body of the person in question, it can be argued that their chances of survival will increase. A stronger, smarter person will be able to handle herself better in case of dangers such as natural disasters or accidents. In addition, the CA can help the users maintain or improve their health by incorporating advanced medical technology. For example, the research is ongoing on the development of nanorobots which are designed to navigate through our bodies' blood vessels, detect cancerous cells, and kill them \cite{nanorobot}. Through the technology of CA, such nanorobots can monitor our body more comprehensively, and perform medical tasks more quickly and efficiently at an early stage. 

{\bf (3) Create new opportunities}\\
Imagining further into the future, CAs may give us the ability to inhabit currently uninhabitable environments; for example, underwater or other planets with hazardous environments. Also, enhancements may lead to the creation of newer jobs and professions; the tasks which are considered as currently impossible or very difficult may become practicable when a workforce with enhanced ability are engaged. Additionally, once CA becomes an active trend for society, there will be more initiatives for further research, development and application of the technology in other fields of science and industry.

{\bf (4) Improve safety and welfare}\\
CA will improve safety beyond the discussed health and physical improvements of the individual. Mankind will be physically and psychologically better equipped to deal with its problems. Society will have a stronger physical presence with improved capacities of the armies and police forces; psychologically our society will be better equipped as our leaders will have enhanced minds which will improve their faculties to solve social and political problems \cite{bostrom2013ethical}. We can also increase safety and moral behaviour of users of CA by incorporating safety and morally right decision making processes or fail safes in the augmentations. As an example imagine cognitive augments which informs the user of locations of rubbish cans if she needs to dispose of some waste; the 'moralization of technology' will be easier and more effective \cite{achterhuis1995moralisering}.

{\bf (4) Increased efficiency and productivity} \\
Enhanced physical capability of the workers by means of CA is most likely to increase the efficiency and productivity of humanity. We will be able to better optimize and specialize our manpower, meaning as a sum effect we will get more done. Augmentations can be doctored to suit the professions of individuals; for example, construction workers can get physical augmentation that make them stronger, miners may consider improving their lungs to filter out harmful pollutants, businessperson can consider neural implants that will keep their mind connected to important information networks.

{\bf (5) Create happiness} \\
Although it can be argued that the cumulative effect of the aforementioned benefits will be a general increase in happiness, the authors wish to assert that CA in and of itself can be a source of greater happiness. Besides the obvious improvement to self image from being able to do more, people maybe able to use CA to fulfil lifelong dreams that were previously unattainable; for example, someone with physical augmentations, wishing to scale mountains but with no previous experience will be safely able to do so. Cognitive augments can monitor the brain for depressive thoughts pattern and attempt to alleviate them for the user by suggesting her activities or providing more context for the sadness by referring to the arts, thereby allowing her to cope better. As extreme cases, neural implants may allow the user to experience a virtual reality or even directly stimulate parts of the brain that make people feel happy.



%Another view with respect to the well-being is that CA can positively affect the users not only physically, but also psychologically, as the extra abilities can plausibly help them gain higher self-esteem and confidence. In particular, for those people with the psychological complex about certain parts of their body, or abilities which they feel inferior themselves, the CA could be used to overcome such complexes and give them more sense of happiness and better well-being.
