		\textbf{ \\ Cybernetic augmentation (in short, CA) technology is a newly emerging field of human engineering. In this essay, the authors analyse and disuss the potential ethical implications of the technology by (1) identifying the plausible benefits and risks from the social, economical, and technological point of view, and (2) applying the normative ethical theories. Major potential benefits of CA are identified as: ease of hardships, improvement of health and survivavility, creation of new opportunities, enhanced sense of safety and welfare, increased efficiency and productivity, and greater happiness. On the other hand, major potential risks could be: detrimental restructuring of human life, loss of humanity, hazard to health, decreased safety and security, and greater unhappiness. Next to the risk-benefit analysis, the ethical aspect of the intoduction of the technology is contemplated in terms of three normative ethical theories - utilitarianism, duty ethics, and virtue ethics. Discussions showed the complexity of the issue, and emphasized the neccessity of a pragmatic application of all three theories in order to obtain a solid ethical code for CA. Finally, the authors provide recommendations which suggest the importnace of a gradual and careful development process in prallel with a continuous public discussion for the better comprehension and appreciation of the technology.\\}
